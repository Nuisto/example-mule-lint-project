# mule-lint-project-example

This is a non-functioning Mule application that shows how a `pom.xml` is
configured along with a `rules.txt` to show what features are supported for
[mule-lint](https://github.com/Nuisto/mule-lint/).

### Running mule-lint

Just run the following commands to see mule-lint in action (don't get your
hopes up, it isn't much)

```
git clone git@github.com:Nuisto/example-mule-lint-project.git
cd example-mule-lint-project
mvn clean compile
cat results.json
```
